# Hydroponic Monitoring System

The Hydroponic Monitoring System is a project designed to monitor and control the environment of a hydroponic setup, which is a method of growing plants without soil, using mineral nutrient solutions in a water solvent. This system enables users to remotely monitor and manage key parameters essential for plant growth, such as temperature, humidity, pH levels, nutrient levels, and light intensity.

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously monitors environmental parameters crucial for plant growth.
- **Remote Access**: Provides access to monitoring data and control features from anywhere with an internet connection.
- **Alerts and Notifications**: Sends alerts and notifications to users in case of deviations from predefined thresholds.
- **Data Logging**: Records historical data for analysis and optimization of growing conditions.
- **Automated Control**: Allows for automation of environmental control systems based on predefined rules and schedules.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Offers an intuitive interface for easy setup and monitoring.

## Hardware Requirements

- Microcontroller (Nodemcu esp8266)
- Sensors for monitoring temperature, humidity, pH levels, nutrient levels, and light intensity
- Internet connectivity module (Wi-Fi, Ethernet, etc.)
- Power supply unit

## Software Requirements

- Firmware for microcontroller programming
- Web server or cloud platform for data storage and remote access
- User interface for monitoring and control (web application.)
- Database for storing historical data
- Alerting and notification system
- Data visualization tools for analysis (optional but recommended)

## Installation

1. **Assemble Hardware**: Connect sensors, actuators, and microcontroller according to the system design.
2. **Install Firmware**: Flash the firmware onto the microcontroller to enable data acquisition and control functionalities.
3. **Set up Web Server or Cloud Platform**: Set up a web server or cloud platform to store data and provide remote access to the monitoring system.(Thingspeak)
4. **Develop User Interface**: Develop a user-friendly interface (web application.) for users to interact with the system.
5. **Configure Alerts and Notifications**: Implement an alerting and notification system to notify users of any abnormal conditions.
6. **Deploy System**: Deploy the complete system in the hydroponic setup and ensure proper connectivity.

## Usage

1. **Access Interface**: Users can access the monitoring system interface through a web browser.
2. **View Monitoring Data**: Users can view real-time data on temperature, humidity, pH levels, nutrient levels, and light intensity.
3. **Receive Alerts**: Users receive alerts and notifications via email, SMS, or app notifications in case of critical conditions.
4. **Analyze Data**: Users can analyze historical data to optimize growing conditions and improve plant health.
